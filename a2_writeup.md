# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

It was difficult applying my understanding of what was needed to match to how to actually execute my idea to coding in python. I am not experienced with the language so it was a struggle to interpret what code to write in order to get a specific task done.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

I could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database by using the ideas of "_" and "%" to ask for different information from a database about a specifc movie. The user could extract specific, filtered information from the database based on their input.
